/**
 * Animation acks (WS Action Bus, Phase 5 / plan §2.7, §5.5).
 *
 * With the stub in per-frame mode (frameDelayMs 150), each street's deal arrives
 * as its own frame. The communityCardStagger decorator opts that frame's
 * `dealCards` hint into a drain-gating ACK; useCardAnimations (mounted in
 * TableBoard) resolves it via bus.ackAnimation once the staggered flip reveal
 * finishes. We assert numerically against window.__B52_BUS__ (§5.4):
 *
 *   - `ackTimeouts === 0` — every street's ack resolved before its timeout fired
 *     (the happy path: the render layer, not a fixed guess, released the drain);
 *   - `pendingAcks === 0` — nothing left dangling at the end of the hand;
 *   - a commitLog inter-commit gap comfortably exceeds the 150ms frame cadence —
 *     lower-bound proof that a commit was HELD by a gate (the flop/turn/river ack
 *     or the showdown hold), not merely paced by frame delay.
 *
 * Lower-bound assertions only, to stay unflaky under scheduler jitter.
