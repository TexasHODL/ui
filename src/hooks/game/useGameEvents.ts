/**
 * useGameEvents — the events of the latest committed bus item (WS Action Bus,
 * Phase 2).
 *
 * Returns the typed transitions ({@link GameEvent}) derived at ingest for the
 * most recent commit, optionally narrowed to a single event type. This replaces
 * the per-consumer `useRef` snapshot diffing (sounds, badges, animations) with
 * one shared, unit-tested source (plan §1.2, Commandment 12).
 *
 * The returned array changes identity on every commit (a fresh item object), so
 * an effect keyed on it fires once per commit — a duplicate frame derives zero
 * events, so no effect re-fires spuriously, and the first frame after
 * subscribe/reset carries no events (no history replay).
 *
 * @param filter - optional event type to keep; omit for all events.
 * @returns the (optionally filtered) events of the latest commit. When filtered,
 *   the element type is narrowed to the matching variant.
